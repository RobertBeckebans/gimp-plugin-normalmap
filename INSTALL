Requirements
=======================================

The only required packages that must be installed to build the plugin
(besides Gtk+ and the GIMP) are:
  
  1) gimp version 2.0.0 or later
  2) pkg-config version 0.14 or later
  3) gtkglext version 0.7.1 or later
    
For RedHat and Mandrake Linux distributions, you'll need to have the 'devel'
RPMs installed for Gtk+, Glib and GIMP.
  
Installation
=======================================

1. Type 'make' to build the plugin
2. Type 'make install' to install the plugin. By default the plugin will be
installed in your GIMP user plugin directory ($HOME/.gimp-2.2/plug-ins).  If
you want to install the plugin system-wide, as root you must manually copy the
plugin to the system GIMP plugin directory.
